/* You are given a list of N coins of different denominations. You can pay an amount equivalent to any 1 coin and can acquire that coin. In addition, once you have paid for a coin, we can choose at most K more coins and can acquire those for free. The task is to find the minimum amount required to acquire all the N coins for a given value of K. */
